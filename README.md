# Dithering Visualization

Dithering algorithms create the illusion of a broader range of colors in images with limited palettes by carefully scattering pixels of different colors. This technique helps prevent harsh transitions between colors, resulting in smoother gradients. Widely used in image compression, displays, and printing, dithering significantly enhances visual quality when fewer colors are available.
## Key Features

- **Color Limitation**: Uses color palettes to simulate a broader range of colors with fewer shades.
- **Gradient Smoothing**: Prevents harsh color transitions and provides a more natural look.
- **Applications**: Commonly applied in image compression, display technologies, and printing for improved image quality.

## Running the Visualization

This project can be run using [Processing](https://processing.org/), a flexible software sketchbook and language for visual arts. Explore and modify the code to see how different dithering techniques affect the final image.
