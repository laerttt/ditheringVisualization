# Dithering Visualization
Dithering algorithms create the illusion of more colors in images with limited palettes by scattering pixels of different colors. This prevents harsh transitions and smooths gradients. It's widely used in image compression, displays, and printing to enhance visual quality when fewer colors are available.
## Can be run using Processing
